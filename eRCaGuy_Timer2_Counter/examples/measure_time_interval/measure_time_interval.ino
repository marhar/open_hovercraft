Timer2_Counter_measure_time_interval.ino
Timer2 Counter Basic Example - Demonstrates use of my Timer2_Counter, which is a timer function with 0.5us precision, 
                               rather than 4us precision like the built-in Arduino micros() function has.

History (newest on top):
20140517 - Timer2_Counter is now a true library!  This is the first example utilizing Timer2_Counter as an actual, installed library. This was a huge challenge for me,
           as this is only my 2nd library I have ever written, and it is the first library I have written with an ISR() in it, which was a special challenge.
20140208 - initial example; required a special "Timer2_Counter.ino" file, with all of the setup & functions, that had to be in the same directory as this example file.

//CODE DESCRIPTION:
//This code demonstrates the use of my Timer2, which provides a more precise timer than micros().  
//micros() has a precision of only 4us.  However, Timer2 keeps track of time to a precision of 0.5us.
//This is especially important in my code which reads an RC receiver PWM signal, which varies from 900~2100us. 
//Though this code demonstrates the use of the Timer_2 functions I have written, it does not adequately demonstrate the 
//real utility of the code, so I will state the following:
//By using my Timer2 timer to measure the PWM high time interval on an RC receiver, in place of using micros(), I can get repeatable 
//pulse width reads with a fluctuation of ~1us, rather than having a read-in range fluctuating by as much as +/- 4~8 us when I use micros().
//This is an increase in precision of ~8x.

//include the library
#include <eRCaGuy_Timer2_Counter.h>

//Note: an object of this class was already pre-instantiated in the .cpp file of this library, so you can simply access its methods (functions)
//      directly now through the object name "timer2"
//eRCaGuy_Timer2_Counter timer2;  //this is what the pre-instantiation line from the .cpp file looks like
  
void setup() {
  //configure Timer2
  timer2.setup(); //this MUST be done before the other Timer2_Counter functions work; Note: since this messes up PWM outputs on pins 3 & 11, as well as 
                  //interferes with the tone() library (http://arduino.cc/en/reference/tone), you can always revert Timer2 back to normal by calling 
                  //timer2.unsetup()
  
  //prepare serial
  Serial.begin(115200);  
  
  //Output a header of info:
  Serial.println(F("Notes:"));
  Serial.println(F("micros() has a precision of 4us"));
  Serial.println(F("get_count() with unsigned long final data type has a final precision of 1us, and is fast"));
  Serial.println(F("get_count() with float final data type has a final precision of 0.5us, and is not quite as fast"));
  Serial.println(F("get_micros() has a precision of 0.5us, and is slower than the above 2 methods, so one of the above 2 methods is preferred"));
  Serial.println(F("=============================================="));
}


void loop() {
  //Grab Start Times
  unsigned long t_start1 = micros(); //us; get the current time using the built-in Arduino function micros(), to a precision of 4us
  unsigned long t_start2 = timer2.get_count(); //count units of 0.5us each; get my Timer2 count, where each count represents 0.5us; PREFERRED METHOD
  float t_start3 = timer2.get_micros(); //us; get the current time using my Timer2; Note: THE METHOD ONE LINE ABOVE IS PREFERRED OVER THIS METHOD
                                        //since using floats is a tiny bit slower than using unsigned longs
  
  //Wait a bit                       
  delayMicroseconds(1000); //wait this # of microseconds; Note: "the largest value that will produce an accurate delay is 16383" - http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/DelayMicroseconds
  //OR:
//  delay(1000); //wait this # of milliseconds
  
  //Grab End Times
  unsigned long t_end1 = micros(); //us; using built-in Arduino function that has a precision of 4us
  unsigned long t_end2 = timer2.get_count(); //count units of 0.5us each; using my Timer2 count, where each count represents 0.5us
  float t_end3 = timer2.get_micros(); //us; using my Timer2 micros, which has a precision of 0.5us
  
  //Calculate elapsed times
  unsigned long t_elapsed1 = t_end1 - t_start1; //us; using micros()
  unsigned long t_elapsed2_ul = (t_end2 - t_start2)/2; //us; to a precision of 1us, due to using unsigned long data type truncation, using Timer2 count
  float t_elapsed2_fl = (t_end2 - t_start2)/2.0; //us; to a precision of 0.5us, due to using float data type for final time difference calc; note that I divide by 2.0, NOT 2
  float t_elapsed3 = t_end3 - t_start3; //us; to a precision of 0.5us
  
  //Display the results
  Serial.println(""); //insert a space
